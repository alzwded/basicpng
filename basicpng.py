"""
Basic PNG decoder, for when you are not allowed to depend on cv or pillow
or any other useful Python/C image library.

PngDecode supports the basic IHDR, IEND, IDAT, PLTE blocks deemed "critical"
for PNG rendering, and none of the extensions.

PngDecode does not support Adam7 interlaced images, only linear scan ones.

PngDecode.get allows you to retrieve RGBA U8 pixels regardless of the physical
storage. This is normally fine, unless you really wanted to read 48bit images
at their full fidelity. Sorry, but you get them downsampled to 24bit.
